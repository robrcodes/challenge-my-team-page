## Built With

- HTML & CSS

## Features

This page was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to build a team/crew page with a 2 column card layout on smaller screens, and a 3 column card layout on larger screens.

I have created a mobile first page using CSS Grid which changes grid-column-template with different sized viewports.

Initially I found lowering the 2nd column cards challenging.
